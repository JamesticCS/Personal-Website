# Project Review: Jesse Hines Personal Website

## Overview
This is a well-structured personal website built with Next.js 13 (App Router), TypeScript, and TailwindCSS. The site features a clean, modern dark theme with a simple and effective layout.

## Strengths
- **Modern Tech Stack**: Next.js 13, TypeScript, TailwindCSS, React Hook Form, Zod
- **Clean Architecture**: Good separation of concerns between pages, components, and content
- **Type Safety**: TypeScript is used throughout for better code reliability
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-friendly layouts
- **Performance**: Static generation capabilities with Next.js
- **Interactive Elements**: Framer Motion animations add polish
- **Form Validation**: Robust form handling with React Hook Form + Zod

## Areas for Improvement

### Content
- **Projects**: Current projects are placeholder data. Replace with actual projects.
- **Blog Content**: Only has a hello world post. Consider adding actual blog posts.
- **SEO**: Consider enhancing metadata for better SEO.

### Features
- **Contact Form**: Currently logs form submissions to console. Implement actual email functionality.
- **Blog Dynamic Routes**: Need to implement the `[slug].tsx` page for individual blog posts.
- **Image Optimization**: Consider adding images with Next.js Image component.
- **Dark/Light Mode Toggle**: Site is currently dark-mode only.

### Code Organization
- **Hook Form Resolver**: `@hookform/resolvers/zod` is used in the contact page but not included in package.json dependencies.
- **Error Handling**: Add error handling to the contact form API endpoint.
- **Loading States**: Consider adding loading states for better UX.

### Accessibility
- **Focus States**: Ensure all interactive elements have visible focus states.
- **Contrast**: Verify text contrast ratios meet WCAG standards.
- **Keyboard Navigation**: Test and ensure keyboard navigation works properly.

## Recommendations
1. Replace placeholder content with real data
2. Implement the blog post individual page view
3. Add proper email sending functionality to the contact form
4. Add appropriate images and graphics (with Next.js Image optimization)
5. Consider adding a light/dark mode toggle
6. Add missing dependencies to package.json
7. Implement proper error handling for the contact form
8. Run accessibility tests and address any issues
9. Consider adding unit tests for key functionality

## Conclusion
The site has a solid foundation with modern technologies and clean architecture. With real content and the implementation of the suggested improvements, it could become an excellent personal portfolio site.
